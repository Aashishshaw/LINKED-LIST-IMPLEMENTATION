  #que 1 -CREATE A PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENT A
SINGLY LINKED LIST WITH OPERATIONS
LIKE INSERTION, DELETION, AND
TRAVERSAL.

  to write this singly linked list program in C, I used a basic text editor to write the code and a C compiler like GCC to compile and run it. The text editor helped me organize the program clearly, and the compiler was useful to test the program and fix any errors. I also used standard C libraries such as <stdio.h> for input/output functions and <stdlib.h> to handle memory allocation and freeing.

The idea to write this program came from learning about data structures in my programming classes and online tutorials. Linked lists are one of the first data structures taught because they show how data can be stored dynamically, unlike arrays which have a fixed size. I learned how to use pointers and manage memory through resources like textbooks and websites that explain the basics of linked lists and their operations like inserting, deleting, and traversing nodes.

This program is useful because it allows storing a list of numbers where items can be added or removed easily without worrying about fixed sizes. It supports adding new elements, deleting elements by value, and printing the whole list. Such linked lists are helpful in many real-life applications like managing tasks, creating queues or stacks, and handling data when the amount of information changes over time. Also, writing this program helped me understand important programming concepts like pointers, memory management, and how linked data structures work.

que 2 - DELIVERABLE: A MODULAR AND
EFFICIENT LINKED LIST
IMPLEMENTATION.

To write this linked list implementation in C, I used a basic text editor combined with a standard C compiler such as GCC. The text editor helped me write and organize the code clearly, while the compiler allowed me to compile and run the program to test each function and ensure correctness. Additionally, I relied on standard C libraries like <stdio.h> for input/output operations, <stdlib.h> for dynamic memory management (malloc and free), and <stdbool.h> for boolean data types to make the code more readable.

The idea for writing this linked list came from foundational data structures concepts taught in computer science courses and reinforced by programming textbooks and online tutorials. Understanding that linked lists are crucial for handling dynamic collections of data without fixed size helped shape the implementation. I also studied how pointers work in C and how to carefully manage memory allocation to avoid leaks. Inspiration came from various educational resources, including university course notes, coding websites like GeeksforGeeks and tutorial blogs, as well as hands-on practice with small coding exercises.

This linked list code is useful for storing and managing a collection of integer elements dynamically. It supports insertion, deletion, and searching, which are common operations needed in many applications such as implementing stacks, queues, or managing datasets that frequently change size. It also serves as an excellent learning tool for mastering pointers, dynamic memory management, and modular programming in C. Overall, it provides a foundation for understanding more complex data structures and algorithms.
